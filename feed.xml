“<em>Statistical Control of the Ecological Risks of Fisheries</em>” under the primary supervision of
Abdul-Lateef Haji-Ali from HWU and co-Supervision of Simeon Hill and Norman Ratcliffe from BAS
and in collaboration with <a href="http://marine.gov.scot/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Marine Scotland</a>. The successful applicant
will be considered for funding for up to 3.5 years on EPSRC stipend level in addition to
tuition fees.</p>

<p>This PhD project will use state-of-the-art statistical methods to analyse the dynamics involved
in fisheries and develop new tools for managing the ecological and financial impacts of
fishing. Fishing competes with predators, such as birds and seals, for resources and might
impact their populations. The analysis of ecosystem dynamics will make use of extensive data
including remote sensed environmental variables and time series of bird, mammal and fish
population and performance estimates. The results of this analysis will then be used in a
simulation framework to develop and test feedback methods for managing the fisheries to control
the risks to marine ecosystems while maintaining economic benefits of fishing. In addition to
working on this project, the PhD candidate will be expected to enrol in several PhD level
courses in the <a href="www.maxwell.ac.uk">Maxwell Institute</a> during the first year of the PhD.</p>

<!-- For full consideration, please apply by **December 31st 2020**. The starting date is in -->
